# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions for the advent of code 2021

Scaffold.py is just a shell to save myself time when making my main executable file.  I just copy it into each puzzle.

All inputs generated with cyberchef.  Here's a sample cyberchef that turns a newline separated list of things into an array of strings:
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'%5C%5Cn'%7D,'%22,%20%22',true,false,true,false)Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'%5E'%7D,'%5B%22',true,false,true,false)Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'$'%7D,'%22%5D',true,false,true,false)&input=b25lCnR3bwp0aHI

Each folder is a number based on the day it's a solution for.  Shared code will live in the root here.

So, yeah, I think that's everything.  If you have any questions, feel free to message me.

Thanks!
